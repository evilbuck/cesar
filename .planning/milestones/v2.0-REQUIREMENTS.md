## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Authentication/API keys | Internal service, not needed |
| Rate limiting | Internal service, not needed |
| Real-time streaming | Different architecture, defer to future |
| Speaker diarization | Complex feature, defer to v3+ |
| CLI refactor to service layer | Defer to v3.0, ship API first |
| Windows support | Focus on Mac/Linux first |

## Traceability
